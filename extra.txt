WolvesDen.ml adds a world_object_i object which functions as a spawn point for Direwolves. Another actor added were the
Direwolves themself in Direwold.ml. WolvesDen creates one if the number of Lannisters is above 8, and there are no
active direwolves. Then, the direwolf travels the map and kills any Lannisters it meets. After killing 5, it returns
to the Wolves Den.
